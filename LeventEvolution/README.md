### __Introduction__

2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048; however, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers. 
2048 is played on a plain 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided.


### __Unique point__

This version is a themed alternative of 2048. The theme is myself, growing up - the small tiles are pictures of me in my childhood, while the bigger the number gets, the older I get on the picture. I decided this theme, because my mother likes to play simple games like solitaire or Candy crush, so I thought I would give her another option to play!
Furthermore, this is a multiplayer game, so 2 people can compete against each other. A regular single player mode is also available.

## Set up

The requirements for the game is a PC of course, and a browser, nothing else. The user should open 'game.html' file, and everything is set up to play.

The game is, of course, best with 2 players playing against each other, but 1 player is enough too.

## Controls

The game has only four controls (per player):

- For Player one:

1. `A` will push the tiles to the left
2. `S` will push the tiles down
3. `D` will push the tiles to the right
4. `W` will push the tiles up

- For Player two:

1. `arrow-left` will push the tiles to the left
2. `arrow-down` will push the tiles down
3. `arrow-right` will push the tiles to the right
4. `arrow-up` will push the tiles up


In one player mode, the user can control the game with all 8 of the buttons.
